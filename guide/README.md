# Introduction

If you're reading this, it probably means that you want to learn Java. Well, you came to the wrong place! This is just a simple compilation of modules + other sources, which I put together to "further my understanding" since writing increases how you understand things by 10% 🤓🤓🤓 (*this is also why everything is split into quarters.*). Feel free to use this site to see what I've put together from our LGs and Modules, or as a simple "reviewer" *even though CS never has written LTs as far as I know.* Don't use this as an actual tutorial when you are starting Java, you are better off going to [dev.java/learn/](https://dev.java/learn/) than this.

## Why did I originally do this?

I don't know. I was quite bored at that time.
